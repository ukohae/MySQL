Mysql database:
==============
 Introductions:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management software that helps users store, 
organize, and later retrieve data. 
- MySQL stores data in tables made up of rows and columns. 
- Users can define, manipulate, control, and query data using Structured Query Language(sql)
RDBMS:
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. 
A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

 steps to reset the root account password:
    =======================================
    1 mysql --version
    2 sudo systemctl stop mysql.service
    3 sudo systemctl status mysql.service
    4 sudo systemctl set-environment MYSQLD_OPTS="--skip-networking --skip-grant-tables"
    5 sudo systemctl start mysql.service
    6 sudo systemctl status mysql.service
    7 sudo mysql -u root
    8 flush privileges;
    9 USE mysql;
    10 ALTER USER  'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'the-new-password';
    11  quit or exit <enter>
    12 sudo killall -u mysql
    13  sudo systemctl restart mysql.service
    14 sudo mysql -u root -p (to connect to your mysql database server by mysql binary method)

MYSQL STATEMENTS AND THEIR SYNTAX:
  Statements: They are use to issue mysql queries

  The SQL SELECT Statement: The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
    syntax:
 SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
  
  The SQL WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
   syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

  The SQL INSERT INTO Statement: The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
   syntax:
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
  
  The SQL UPDATE Statement: The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
   syntax:
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;

  The SQL DELETE Statement: The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
  syntax:
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

  The SQL SELECT TOP Clause: The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
    syntax:
  SELECT column_name(s)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  LIMIT number;

MYSQL user management:
     How to Create a New User:
    =========================
    step 1: CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    NB: Just by creating the new user they do not have permissions to access the Database
    
    step 2: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
    NB: First * means all databases and the second * means all tables
     
    step 3: FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    NB: you can also use ctrl + l to clear your mysql shell terminal
        or system clear;

  How to list all users in mysql database?
  ans: switch the mysql database type
       select the user table
      select user from user ; to see all list of users 

  How can you see who is running the query?
  ans: select user();

  How can you switch user in mysql?
  ans: system mysql -u username -p  


    How To Grant Different User Permissions:
    ========================================
ALL PRIVILEGES: as we saw previously, this would allow a MySQL user full access to \
a designated database (or if no database is selected, global access across the system)
CREATE: allows them to create new tables or databases
DROP: allows them to them to delete tables or databases
DELETE: allows them to delete rows from tables
INSERT: allows them to insert rows into tables
SELECT: allows them to use the SELECT command to read through databases
UPDATE: allow them to update table rows
GRANT OPTION: allows them to grant or remove other users’ privileges

To provide a specific user with a permission, you can use this framework:
  GRANT (type_of_permission) ON (database_name.table_name) TO 'username'@'localhost';

  NB: each time you alter a permission, be sure to run the command (flush privileges;)
If you need to revoke a permission, the structure is almost identical to granting it:

  REVOKE (type_of_permission) ON (database_name.table_name) FROM 'username'@'localhost';
You can review a user’s current permissions by running the following:

  SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
Just as you can delete databases with DROP, you can use DROP to delete a user altogether:

  DROP USER 'username'@'localhost';
To test out your new user, log out by typing:
  quit;
  and log back in with this command in terminal:
    mysql -u [username] -p

 DATA TYPE:
      - CHAR(size) --> A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters)
      - VARCHAR(size) --> A VARIABLE length string  can vary from 0 to 65535 
      - BINARY(size) -->  Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1
      - TEXT(size)-> Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes
      - BOOL -> Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true
      - INT(size) --> A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647
      - FLOAT(p)--> A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size
      - DATE --> A date. Format YYYY-MM-DD
      - DATETIME(fsp)->A date and time combination. Format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.
      - TIME(fsp)--> A time. Format hh:mm:ss.
      - YEAR -->  A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format 1901 to 2155, and 0000.
                  MySQL 8.0 does not support year in two-digit format.
